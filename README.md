# Malware-Detection

## Problem Statement
Zero-day : A zero-day vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to those who would be interested in mitigating the vulnerability. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network.

Zero-day malware cannot be caught as such using the conventional malware detection system which heavily depend on the manual creation of signature to detect malware files, based of the research done in Max Secure Software laboratories, it was found out that Machine learning techniques could perform well in detecting zero-day vulnerabilities (focused of malware files), if trained properly on suitable models. We bring you the opportunity to work on the data extracted from the statistical analysis conducted of a large set of malware and legitimate files to build ML programs that can perform efficiently in detecting malware files.

There is one catch though, it is necessary for malware detection systems to ensure no legitimate files are predicted as malware, because deleting a legitimate file could lead to serious loss of the users. Final evaluation of the candidates considered for the cash price which will be done manually by a jury, if your model predicts any legitimate files as malicious - strong penalty will be imposed which may lead you to lose the competition even if you rank well on kaggle score boards. Ensure that the false positive predictions are as low as 0.001% .

The test-data for the competition has been updated , please download and use the updated data for submission

The penalty for false negative classifications will be relative. The final ranking on evaluation will look only on the the number of false negatives. More false negative will lead to a lower rank. By false negative here i mean the number of legitimate files considered as malicious
